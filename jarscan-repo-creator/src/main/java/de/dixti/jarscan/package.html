    With the classes in this package you can use JarScan programmatically. 
    With {@link de.dixti.jarscan.JarScan} you can set all the flags that you know from using jarscan
    as a command line tool. {@link de.dixti.jarscan.JarScan#scan()} starts the scanning. It returns the
    results of scanning as a {@link de.dixti.jarscan.Result}.
    E.g. you can use the result to print it. There is also another way to do this.
    You can set your own printer with 
    {@link de.dixti.jarscan.JarScan#setPrinter(Printer)}. Then
    jarscan will call your Printer every time after scanning an archive.
